# Recipe App

> This is a complex Recipe app built using Ruby on Rails framework. The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app allows you to make some of your recipes public so that anyone can access them.
